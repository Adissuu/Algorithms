1. Question 1

    Class 1: Positional ADT is the best data type to use in this case since it works with the position, and gives the user the possibility to add and remove items.

    Class 2: List ADT is what should be use in this case since it uses indices. It also has the functions required already implemented.

    Class 3: Sequence ADT is best in this class as it is great in storing an ordered collection of elements. Packages can be added anytime and sorted.

2. Question 2

    Input: Stack S and Queue Q, and an element E
    temp

    found <- false

    FOR i <- 0 to N do
        Q.enqueue() = S.pop()
    FOR i <- 0 to N do
        S.push() = Q.dequeue()
    FOR i <- 0 to N do
        temp = S.pop()
        if temp is equal to E
            found <- true
        Q.enqueue() = temp
    FOR i <- 0 to N do
        S.push() = Q.dequeue()

    return found

3. Question 3
    
    We should implement a double ended queue in this case, as it would give the permision to queue from the end and from the start and dequeue from both as well. However, we need to turn this into an array list ADT, so we will simply modify the methods.
